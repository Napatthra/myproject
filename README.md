ABSTRACT

According to the environment changing in many areas such as the expansion of communities or coastal erosion, which could happen at any time. With the advance in technology nowadays, providing following and inspecting system to monitor the environmental changes would be an effective way to manage resources. In our report, a development of environment change tracking from an artificial satellite system is introduced. The users could choose the areas of interest for monitoring the suspecting changes that might occur during the specific period of time. Moreover, the users could save the tracking results in that particular area of interest for convinien retrieval. The users could set a facebook notification when the changes exceed the limit specified in usersâ€™ setting.  This system will report the changes in geographical areas by comparing artificial satellite images at different periods of time.  The detection results will be displayed in various ways such as the picture with coloring the changes, the animated pictures demonstrating the changes occur during each period of time, graph presentation showing percentage of changes over time.
